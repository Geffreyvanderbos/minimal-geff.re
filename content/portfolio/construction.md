# Making construction measurement management digital

Company: Bitfactory GmbH<br>
Role: Lead Designer<br>
Date: 2019 - 2021

***
Led design for [Construction Corporation]'s digital transformation of on-site measurement and architectural plan management.

Goal: Replace slow, traditional paper-based methods.

## Key challenges
* Tough on-site conditions (gloves, weather).
* Low-effort measurement and real-time plan updates needed.
* Poor communication between site and architects.

The left side shows the main plan with blue highlights and annotations, while a semi-transparent panel on the right allows for comparing various revisions (e.g., '5 hours ago,' '4 hours ago'). The interface is clean and technical, with a focus on precision and detail." />

<img src="/images/case-study-construction-2.png" class="transparent" alt="A tablet displays a data input form, likely for specifying dimensions or properties in a construction or architectural context. The interface features clearly labeled fields for measurements like 'Breite' (width), 'Höhe' (height), and 'Wandstärke' (wall thickness), along with corresponding input fields and toggle switches. A digital keyboard is visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for user input. A small floor plan is visible on the left, providing visual context." />

## My contributions
* Extensive user research loop, on and off construction sites.
* Designed iPad and web apps for usability in various environments.
* Managed communication flow between teams.

The layout is organized with clear labels, and a sidebar provides additional tools or information." />

## The solution
* **iPad App:** Glove-friendly, Bluetooth connection to measurement tools (less interaction).
* **Web Platform:** Plan uploads, route planning, and direct feedback.

The main message pane shows a blueprint or floor plan preview. The interface features a clean and organized layout, common in contemporary messaging applications, with a sidebar for contacts or channels and a clear message window." />

## Results
Faster measurement times. Improved communication between site and architects. Positive user feedback on ease of use and efficiency.
