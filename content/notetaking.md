# Linked Note-taking

When you link the notes you take, you're not just passively storing information; you're actively connecting and articulating how ideas relate.

Which spark insights that wouldn't appear otherwise.

## How do I get started?
It's up to you to figure out a methodology that works best. Most techniques boil down to the following:

1. As you consume information, write down your ideas as separate notes. In your own words.
2. Review your new and existing notes and think about which are related. Create links between them, explaining your future self why the notes are connected.
3. As you add more notes and links, you build a network of your own knowledge.
4. This network lets you explore what you know, leading to new understandings; which in turn, lead to new notes.

And the circle continues.

It's a process that's best experienced through practice. 

You will understand its potential the first time you link two notes that spark an completely new insight.

It's quite addicting.
