# Stepping off the hedonic treadmill – why we are rarely satisfied

Humans have a tendency to adapt to positive or negative life changes. Always returning to their baseline happiness.

This tendency–what Brickman and Campbell (1971) call *hedonic adaptation*–explains why the joy of a new purchase, promotion, or achievement often fades surprisingly quickly.

And I struggle with it continously.

As I write this, I have this nagging thought that “I should move closer to a city; that’ll make me happier”. Knowing full well that once I’ve moved, I’d be hunting down the next thing that *might make me happier*.

Although the hedonic treadmill alone gives us a rather pessimistic outlook, recent research updated the model with some positive elements:
1. most individuals have a positive rather than neutral baseline,
2. set points vary between individuals based on personality factors,
3. people have multiple happiness set points across different life domains,
4. adaptation rates differ between individuals, and
5. people can learn skills to sustainably enhance well-being.

The last point offers hope and begs the question: *what skills can I learn  to overcome hedonic adaptation?*

## Intentionally do positive activities
When our salary increases, our happiness goes up temporarily. However, once we adapt to being able to spend more, we adjust our aspirations upward–we want more.

This *preference drift* makes it really hard to gain long-term happiness.

Yet, research suggests that despite the adaptation process, intentional positive activities can still help increase well-being and reducing depressive symptoms.

Positive strategies can be: 
- expressing gratitude
- practicing optimistic thinking
- replaying positive experiences
- socialising

The effects are especially strong when you knowlingly commit to these activities.

## Mindfulness, Gratitude and Appreciation
Mindfulness, as part of the Hedonic Adaptation Prevent Mode, fights adaptation by allowing us to focus on what we already have. The act of noticing, focusing on, and valuing what we possess can disrupt the psychological process of taking things for granted.

When you are in a more mindful state, you reduce your impulsitivity. You start devalue future rewards which leads to more balanced decision-making.

A proactive orientation–like turning off your phone while enjoying something–also helps us enjoy the hedonic activities without being disrupted by instrusive thoughts about competing goals or responsibilities.

# 3. Gratitude and Appreciation Practices
Gratitude and appreciation practices represent powerful strategies for counteracting hedonic adaptation by shifting attention from what is missing to what is present in one's life. 

This approach explicitly disrupts the psychological process that leads people to take positive circumstances for granted—a key driver of hedonic adaptation. 

By consciously noticing, focusing on, and valuing what one has, individuals can experience familiar pleasures with renewed appreciation, essentially seeing them "afresh" <Paper corpusId="149842782" paperTitle="(Fagley, 2018)" isShortName></Paper>. This aligns with the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model, which specifically identifies appreciation as a critical pathway for avoiding hedonic adaptation <Paper corpusId="149842782" paperTitle="(Fagley, 2018)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="142509693" paperTitle="(Sheldon et al., 2013)" isShortName></Paper>.

Several effective gratitude interventions have been developed and validated through research. Narrative methods such as gratitude journals allow individuals to systematically document things they appreciate, creating a sense of abundance <Paper corpusId="204388135" paperTitle="(Simons et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="14411700" paperTitle="(Lambert et al., 2012)" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, life review interventions that incorporate gratitude and appreciation elements have shown effectiveness in improving psychological well-being <Paper corpusId="204388135" paperTitle="(Simons et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="38756731" paperTitle="(Korte et al., 2011)" isShortName></Paper>. These approaches may help defy the hedonic treadmill by redirecting attention to existing sources of happiness rather than constantly seeking new ones <Paper corpusId="204388135" paperTitle="(Simons et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="19773376" paperTitle="(Davis et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper>.

The empirical evidence for gratitude interventions is substantial. Meta-analyses show that gratitude practices outperform measurement-only controls on measures of psychological well-being and alternative activities on measures of both gratitude and psychological well-being <Paper corpusId="19773376" paperTitle="(Davis et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper>. A landmark study by Seligman and colleagues found that certain positive interventions, including gratitude exercises, produced lasting increases in happiness and decreases in depressive symptoms <Paper corpusId="204388135" paperTitle="(Simons et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="6262678" paperTitle="(Seligman et al., 2005)" isShortName></Paper>.

The effectiveness of gratitude practices in combating hedonic adaptation may relate to their ability to break the cycle of "ever-increasing amounts of money in search of ever-declining rewards" that characterizes hedonic consumption <Paper corpusId="267941064" paperTitle="(Gladstone et al., 2024)" isShortName></Paper>. By cultivating awareness and appreciation of what one already possesses, these practices can reduce the drive for constant acquisition that fuels the hedonic treadmill. This shift in focus supports the critical revisions to the hedonic treadmill model proposed by Diener and colleagues, which suggest that sustainable happiness increases are indeed possible through intentional activities <Paper corpusId="267941064" paperTitle="(Gladstone et al., 2024)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="16206976" paperTitle="(Diener et al., 2006)" isShortName></Paper>.

# Environmental Modifications

> **TL;DR:** Strategically modifying your environment can help overcome the hedonic treadmill by reducing exposure to temptations and creating cues that support healthier choices. Research shows that simple changes like keeping tempting items out of sight and using visual reminders can significantly reduce impulsive consumption with minimal effort. (11 sources)

Environmental modifications represent a powerful approach to countering hedonic adaptation by changing the physical contexts that trigger impulsive or hedonic behaviors. In today's "obesogenic environment" where temptations are constantly available, strategically altering one's surroundings can be particularly effective <Paper corpusId="8624675" paperTitle="(Papies et al., 2013)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="27717146" paperTitle="(Hill et al., 2003)" isShortName></Paper>. This approach acknowledges that much human behavior is automatic, cued by environmental stimuli, rather than resulting from conscious reflection <Paper corpusId="15596499" paperTitle="(Marteau et al., 2012)" isShortName></Paper>.

One fundamental environmental strategy is reducing the visibility of tempting items. Simply keeping hedonic temptations out of sight can prevent the activation of hedonic goals in the first place <Paper corpusId="14976882" paperTitle="(Papies, 2012)" isShortName></Paper>. Research demonstrates that both visibility and convenience significantly influence consumption patterns, often without consumers being aware of these effects <Paper corpusId="5309108" paperTitle="(Painter et al., 2002)" isShortName></Paper>. For example, placing healthy foods at eye level while making less healthy options less accessible can subtly guide better choices.

Conversely, environmental cues can be strategically positioned to activate health goals at critical decision points. For dieters, placing personalized reminders in strategic locations—such as on the refrigerator or cookie cupboard—can influence behavior when one is about to indulge in high-calorie snacks <Paper corpusId="14976882" paperTitle="(Papies, 2012)" isShortName></Paper>. An advantage of this approach is that it requires minimal effort yet can effectively counter the automatically triggered hedonic responses <Paper corpusId="229332587" paperTitle="(Stampfli et al., 2020)" isShortName></Paper>.

Environmental design can also help prime healthy choices in commercial settings. Research suggests that manipulating the availability, positioning, and properties of foods in shopping environments can shift preferences away from unhealthy choices toward healthier alternatives <Paper corpusId="256510281" paperTitle="(Dutriaux et al., 2021)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="42529195" paperTitle="(Papies, 2017)" isShortName></Paper>. These interventions work by changing the situational cues that typically trigger unhealthy habits or hedonic goals.

A particularly innovative approach involves leveraging social media to reinforce desired behaviors. The "#LookWhatIDidNotBuy" concept exemplifies how technology can be used to modify the social environment by encouraging users to share photos of goods they resisted purchasing, thereby providing positive reinforcement for breaking the cycle of hedonic consumption <Paper corpusId="3707535" paperTitle="(Campos, 2018)" isShortName></Paper>. This approach acknowledges the social dimension of consumption and harnesses it to support behavioral change.

Another promising environmental strategy is enhancing the hedonic appeal of healthier alternatives. Research demonstrates that bringing out the sensory enjoyment of healthier options through appealing descriptions that trigger eating simulations can increase their attractiveness <Paper corpusId="221162388" paperTitle="(Papies et al., 2020)" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, encouraging people to rehearse what they found enjoyable about healthier foods can increase remembered enjoyment, subsequently influencing future food choices <Paper corpusId="24029779" paperTitle="(Robinson et al., 2012)" isShortName></Paper>.

# Self-Control and Planning Strategies

> **TL;DR:** Self-control strategies help overcome the hedonic treadmill by enabling individuals to deliberately plan and manage their pleasure-seeking behaviors. Research shows that proactive approaches like purchase planning, mindfulness training, and future-oriented thinking can reduce impulsive decisions while helping people derive greater enjoyment from intentional hedonic experiences. (11 sources)

Self-control strategies represent a crucial approach to managing hedonic adaptation, with research showing that people high in self-control may actually derive greater enjoyment from hedonic activities precisely because they engage in them more deliberately. Rather than avoiding pleasurable activities entirely, individuals with higher self-control tend to indulge more strategically, allowing them to extract more satisfaction from these experiences <Paper corpusId="248969820" paperTitle="(Balleyer et al., 2022)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="149918765" paperTitle="(Jia et al., 2018)" isShortName></Paper>. This counterintuitive finding suggests that developing self-control might enhance rather than diminish hedonic enjoyment.

Proactive strategies represent a particularly effective approach to self-regulation. Recent developments in self-control research indicate that changing situations before conflicts arise may be more effective than relying on willpower in the moment <Paper corpusId="259457806" paperTitle="(Becker et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="46455659" paperTitle="(Duckworth et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper>. For example, turning off one's phone during leisure time can prevent intrusive thoughts about work from undermining enjoyment <Paper corpusId="259457806" paperTitle="(Becker et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="145095444" paperTitle="(Grund et al., 2014)" isShortName></Paper>. These situation-selection strategies minimize the need for effortful inhibition while maximizing hedonic experiences.

Emotional awareness interventions can also enhance self-control by altering how individuals weigh different types of emotions in decision-making. Research shows that increasing the salience of self-conscious emotions (like pride or guilt) tends to increase judgments favoring self-control, while focusing on basic hedonic emotions (like pleasure or pain) typically results in choices that favor immediate gratification <Paper corpusId="198119977" paperTitle="(Kotabe et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that simply becoming more conscious of long-term emotional consequences can shift decision-making toward more sustainable choices.

For those seeking to reduce impulsive consumption, several evidence-based training approaches have shown promise. Mindfulness-based interventions have emerged as particularly effective in reducing delay discounting—the tendency to devalue future rewards in favor of immediate gratification <Paper corpusId="237330285" paperTitle="(Heilman et al., 2021)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="52092273" paperTitle="(Rung et al., 2018)" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, interventions that increase future orientation, such as episodic future thinking, can help individuals make decisions that better align with their long-term interests <Paper corpusId="237330285" paperTitle="(Heilman et al., 2021)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="195798473" paperTitle="(Scholten et al., 2019)" isShortName></Paper>.

Practical applications of these principles include making concrete purchase plans before shopping, engaging in regular exercise to strengthen general self-control capacity, and using positive emotional experiences to counteract the negative emotions that often trigger impulsive hedonic consumption <Paper corpusId="260045941" paperTitle="(Xiao et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="12823588" paperTitle="(Baumeister, 2002)" isShortName></Paper>. These approaches can help individuals navigate the challenges of the hedonic treadmill by enhancing their ability to make deliberate choices about when and how to indulge, rather than responding reactively to environmental cues or emotional states.

# Variety and Novelty Approaches

**TL;DR:** Incorporating variety and novelty into experiences helps counteract hedonic adaptation by maintaining interest and slowing the adaptation process. Strategic approaches to diversifying consumption can break the cycle of diminishing returns from repetitive pleasurable experiences. (2 sources)

* **Diversify hedonic experiences**: Increase variety in pleasurable experiences, especially in hedonic (rather than utilitarian) spending. Research indicates that people adapt more slowly to varied, surprising, and novel stimuli, making this approach particularly effective for countering the forces of hedonic adaptation. <Paper corpusId="267941064" paperTitle="(Gladstone et al., 2024)" isShortName></Paper>

* **Break consumption patterns**: Consciously vary consumption patterns to prevent falling into an "addictive cycle of spending and consumption" where you need ever-increasing amounts of money to chase ever-declining rewards. This disrupts the automatic nature of hedonic adaptation. <Paper corpusId="267941064" paperTitle="(Gladstone et al., 2024)" isShortName></Paper>

* **Introduce surprise elements**: Incorporate unexpected or surprising elements into regular pleasurable activities. The Hedonic Adaptation Prevention (HAP) model suggests that surprise helps maintain interest in purchases and experiences, slowing down the adaptation process. <Paper corpusId="267941064" paperTitle="(Gladstone et al., 2024)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="142509693" paperTitle="(Sheldon et al., 2013)" isShortName></Paper>

* **Rotate pleasurable activities**: Instead of indulging in the same pleasurable activity repeatedly, create a rotation of different enjoyable experiences. This approach helps keep experiences fresh and prevents the diminishing returns that typically occur with repetition. <Paper corpusId="142509693" paperTitle="(Sheldon et al., 2013)" isShortName></Paper>

* **Experiment with novel experiences**: Regularly try new activities and experiences rather than relying on familiar sources of pleasure. Novel experiences tend to generate stronger emotional responses and are less subject to immediate adaptation. <Paper corpusId="142509693" paperTitle="(Sheldon et al., 2013)" isShortName></Paper>

* **Space out pleasurable experiences**: Rather than consuming pleasurable experiences in rapid succession, space them out over time. This temporal variety helps preserve their hedonic impact and prevents rapid adaptation. <Model name="Anthropic" version="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219">

* **Combine complementary pleasures**: Pair different types of pleasurable experiences that enhance each other rather than competing for attention. This approach creates unique combined experiences that are less susceptible to adaptation. <Model name="Anthropic" version="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219">

# Balancing Hedonic and Eudaimonic Well-being

> **TL;DR:** Overcoming the hedonic treadmill requires balancing pleasure-seeking (hedonic) with meaning-focused (eudaimonic) approaches to well-being. Research shows that excessive focus on either dimension can be harmful, while an integrated approach that includes both enjoyable experiences and purposeful activities offers a more sustainable path to happiness. (9 sources)

Addressing the hedonic treadmill effectively requires understanding the distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions of well-being and developing strategies to balance them. Hedonic well-being focuses on pleasure, positive emotions, and pain avoidance, while eudaimonic well-being encompasses meaning, purpose, and optimal functioning <Paper corpusId="255933921" paperTitle="(George et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper>. The hedonic treadmill—our tendency to adapt to pleasurable experiences, requiring ever-increasing stimulation to maintain the same level of happiness—highlights the limitations of pursuing hedonic well-being exclusively <Paper corpusId="255933921" paperTitle="(George et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="16206976" paperTitle="(Diener et al., 2006)" isShortName></Paper>.

Research indicates that overemphasizing any single dimension of well-being can be counterproductive. The single-minded pursuit of pleasure and extrinsic rewards perpetuates the hedonic treadmill cycle <Paper corpusId="261855726" paperTitle="(Fave et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="24085298" paperTitle="(Diener, 2000)" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, excessive focus on flow-inducing activities or singular interests, while eudaimonic in nature, can lead to physical impairments (as observed in musicians), neglect of other life domains, or obsessive passion <Paper corpusId="261855726" paperTitle="(Fave et al., 2023)" isShortName></Paper>.

An integrative approach distinguishes between different types of positive experiences. Seligman and colleagues differentiate between "pleasure"—the satisfaction of basic homeostatic needs like hunger or comfort—and "enjoyment," which transcends homeostasis through activities like artistic performance, stimulating conversation, or athletic events <Paper corpusId="245552883" paperTitle="(Reybrouck et al., 2021)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="14783574" paperTitle="(Seligman et al., 2000)" isShortName></Paper>. This distinction helps individuals recognize and cultivate both hedonic components (pleasure, positive affect) and eudaimonic components (meaning, optimal functioning) in their experiences <Paper corpusId="245552883" paperTitle="(Reybrouck et al., 2021)" isShortName></Paper>.

Despite scientific pessimism about our ability to increase happiness—based on concepts of genetic determination, personality stability, and the hedonic treadmill—research now offers reasons for optimism <Paper corpusId="8231355" paperTitle="(Lopes et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper>. Meta-analyses of positive psychology interventions show that strategies combining hedonic and eudaimonic elements can significantly enhance well-being and decrease depressive symptoms <Paper corpusId="8231355" paperTitle="(Lopes et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="6823410" paperTitle="(Sin et al., 2009)" isShortName></Paper>. Activities such as expressing gratitude, practicing optimistic thinking, replaying positive experiences, and socializing have demonstrated effectiveness, particularly when participants knowingly choose and commit to these interventions <Paper corpusId="8231355" paperTitle="(Lopes et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId="7476527" paperTitle="(Lyubomirsky et al., 2011)" isShortName></Paper>.

A balanced approach to well-being recognizes that hedonic adaptation isn't inherently negative—it's an adaptive mechanism that allows us to respond to changing circumstances. The challenge lies in engaging with both hedonic and eudaimonic pursuits intentionally, understanding that sustainable happiness comes not from maximizing pleasure or meaning in isolation, but from their thoughtful integration across life domains <Model name="Anthropic" version="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219">.
