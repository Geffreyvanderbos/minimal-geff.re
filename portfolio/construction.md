# Making construction measurement management digital

Company: Bitfactory GmbH<br>
Role: Lead Designer<br>
Date: 2019 - 2021

***
As the lead designer for the [Construction Corporation] project, I focused on enhancing the efficiency of measuring and producing frames, doors, and gates for large construction projects. The project aimed to revolutionize traditional methods used in site measurements and architectural plan management.

## The challenge
Key challenges included:
- Adapting to the physical demands of construction sites, with tools and processes suitable for workers in gloves and waterproof gear.
- Developing a system for efficient on-site measurements and real-time architectural plan updates.
- Improving communication between construction teams and architects, traditionally hampered by disjointed email and phone interactions.

## The solution
Highlights of the platform.
- iPad Application: Designed for use with gloves, featuring Bluetooth connectivity for measurement tools and with that reducing neccessary interaction.
- Architect's Tool: An web-based application for uploading plans, planning routes, and streamlining feedback between architects and construction teams.
