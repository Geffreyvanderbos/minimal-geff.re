### Sally Amin
Geffrey was senior to Sally but didn't manage Sally directly ∙ February 27, 2020

> I got the pleasure to work under Geffrey’s supervision for a year at Bitfactory. He has been of great influence to my learning experience as I get introduced to User Interface Design, and to the tech industry. Geffrey is a very eager learner himself and is always seeking knowledge, which I find truly inspiring. He is very knowledgeable and committed to the best practices when it comes to UX design and makes sure only the best scenario is implemented. As a leader, he watches closely and caters to his colleagues’ learning needs and experience, and is very happy to pass on all the knowledge he has.

Worked with Geffrey on the same team ∙ December 5, 2022

> I worked alongside Geffrey in the same team at Kaios.ai. I really cherished the time we worked together. He was one of the nicest guys on our team, who knew the right balance to have productivity and fun in the workplace at the same time. He is the go-to person, with whom you can freely share your professional as well as personal stuff. Besides this, he is a pragmatic, customer-focused, and result-driven individual. One thing that I like about him is his inquisitive nature, the way he keeps himself up-to-date with the latest industry trends, standards, and best practices, and also motivates his peers to do the same. His good communication skills and diverse experience in different IT domains make him a great asset to any organization.
