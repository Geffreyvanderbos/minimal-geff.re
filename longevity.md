# Embracing Simplicity and Longevity
I’ve enjoyed sharing snippets and thoughts through my microblogging site.

It’s been a fun space and I learned a lot while programming it.

However, maintaining a relatively complex website had become a demanding task. The constant need for updates, troubleshooting, and the sheer volume of potential content felt like it was pulling me away from the core reason I started a blog.

To learn, write and share.

I’ve made the decision to step away from the microblog and replace it with a future-oriented one: an *evergreen* website built on Markdown and an extremely simple [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) setup.

I’ve found my time and energy are best focused on creating content with lasting value. For instance, on my [Substack](https://geffrey.substack.com/) about Music Science.

I won't be leaving everything behind, though. I’ll be curating the most popular write-ups from my microblog and giving them a new home in this more permanent space.

This isn't goodbye to sharing; it's a path to a more sustainable and intentional way of doing things.

I am slowly archiving my old posts. It'll take some time. In the mean time, connect with on [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/ctlD__2i3DbpPnd4CRwgxIbCMTPOCwvD7chjLP77QNsQsUEeDLBPz7-3iq0tz7UC).
